# Changelog

## Version 2.0 - Side-by-Side Visual Diff (Current)

### Major Changes
- **Complete UI Redesign**: Replaced single-pane unified diff with true side-by-side comparison
- **VIMDIFF-style Layout**: Both files displayed side by side with synchronized scrolling
- **Enhanced Visual Highlighting**:
  - üü¢ Green background: Lines added (only in right file)
  - üî¥ Red background: Lines removed (only in left file)
  - üü° Yellow background: Lines changed (different content)
  - ‚ö™ Gray background: Empty spaces for alignment
- **Line Numbers**: Each line now shows its line number for easy reference
- **Synchronized Scrolling**: Mouse wheel scrolls both panes together
